# Shooting Gallery

This project was completed by Ian Anderson and Madeline Seraphin for our CS 4550 Web Development course. We created a Shooting Gallery game, inspired by the one on Wii Play, that can be played by two players simultaneously on different browsers. We utilized Web Sockets to make this live-updating game work.
